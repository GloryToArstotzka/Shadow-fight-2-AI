# Shadow-fight-2-AI
This project is about a DQN agent trying to play Shadow Fight 2 using visual input.

[First of all , I'm not a native english speaker so I'm sure there are mistakes]

Status :

File1 : working 

File2 : in progress

Example : [This is just an example of a working DQN that works on the cartpole game using openai gym] working


Screen_Grabber : working [not made by me btw]


Usage:

File 1 : It has been tested on an 1080p resolution , to make it work you need bluestacks in the smallest window size you can get
after that just open shadow fight 2 and when you run the code it will detect the hp bars of you and the enemy and will say
if the round is finished or not. Note that it won't work if you move bluestacks after the code started and sometimes the code
will detect hp bars that aren't there because it just compares the hp values

File 2 : It's supposed to be the main file , because it will be a remade version of "Example" 

Example : working , but has no use more than an example

Screen_Grabber : it's obvious what it does
