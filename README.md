# Shadow-fight-2-AI
This project is about a DQN agent trying to play Shadow Fight 2 using visual input.

[First of all , I'm not a native english speaker so I'm sure there are mistakes]

## Status :

File1 : working 

File2 : working

Example : [This is just an example of a working DQN that works on the cartpole game using openai gym] working


Screen_Grabber : working [not made by me btw]


## Usage:

### File 1 : It has been tested on an 1080p resolution , to make it work you need bluestacks in the smallest window size you can get
after that just open shadow fight 2 and you run file2 [file1 just holds important functions is the place to test them] , it will do random stuff as it tries to learn , an episode equals 1 round and its considered started if on the screen the timer shows 98 and the game is not paused. Currently you have to manually start rounds , it may be a auto-train in the future


#### Update : Now by using the 2 new functions you can see when the rounds are paused or when the rounds just started

#### Update : Now you can give input to the game [list of inputs is unfinished]

### File 2 : It's supposed to be the main file , because it will be a remade version of "Example" 

### Update : It's working as intended now [it's usage is in the USAGE up there]

### Update : I replaced most of the variables with variables got from File1 , it needs the rest of the actions and it SHOULD work

### Example : working , but has no use more than an example in case I mess up the file

### Screen_Grabber : it's obvious what it does

#### Update : now you can specify the color of the image
